        "A data structure is a way of organizing, storing, and managing data so it can be used efficiently.\n",
        "Think of it like containers for data: just like you use boxes, shelves, or folders to organize things in real life, programmers use data structures to organize data inside a computer.\n",
        "\n",
        "Some common data structures are:\n",
        "\n",
        "Arrays – store items in a sequence.\n",
        "\n",
        "Linked Lists – connect elements with pointers.\n",
        "\n",
        "Stacks – last-in, first-out (like a stack of plates).\n",
        "\n",
        "Queues – first-in, first-out (like a line at a ticket counter).\n",
        "\n",
        "Trees – hierarchical structure (like a family tree).\n",
        "\n",
        "Graphs – represent networks (like social media connections).\n",
        "\n",
        "Hash Tables – store key-value pairs for fast lookup.\n",
        "\n",
        "Why are They Important?\n",
        "\n",
        "Efficiency – The right data structure makes programs faster and use less memory.\n",

        "Example: Looking up a name in a phone book is faster if it’s sorted.\n",

        "Reusability – Once you learn them, you can apply them in many areas.\n",
